# MediaFire Automatique File Uploader

A script that automates MediaFire file upload. This is a first release & I'm still discovering their API so there might be some unexpected stuff. 
I might improve this later on if I got time.

Simply write your email & password in a config file named `config.json`. You'll file a `config.json.template` for an example.

Requirements:
* BeautifulSoup 4
* Requests
